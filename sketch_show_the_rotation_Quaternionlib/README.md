Processing rotation example

================
Rotation demostration of [LSM9DS0](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12636) breakout board.

This is a Processing example using quaternion readout from arduino and LSM9DS0 tri-axies IMU breakout board
to show the rotation of the chip. 

The arduino code was modified from [kriswiner's LSM9DS0 AHRS sketch](https://github.com/kriswiner/LSM9DS0).
