Project-tiger-II
================

Project tiger II is about my vision data fusion robotic project.
This project involve the IMU optical camerma and IR data fusion in a UGV(unmanned ground vehicle).

Why Tiger II? My frist plan is to use a Tiger II model as the platform. Sure I have better choice, but the name has settled and I'm a WWII fan.
