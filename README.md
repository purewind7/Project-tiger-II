Project-tiger-II
================


Oct. 16, 2014

Project tiger II is about my vision data fusion robotic project.

This project involves the IMU optical camera and IR data fusion in a UGV(unmanned ground vehicle). Future plan will be the UAVs version (quad/fixed-wing).

Why Tiger II? My first plan is to use a WWII german panther Tiger II model as the platform. Sure I have better choices, but the name has settled and I'm a WWII fan. So that's it! Hope me good luck.
